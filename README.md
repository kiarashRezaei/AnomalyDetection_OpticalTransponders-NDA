# AnomalyDetection_OpticalTransponders-NDA
 This repository contains Jupyter notebooks of 2 different approaches for an anomaly detection task as the final project of Network Data Analysis course (A.Y. 22/23) at Politecnico di Milano. It aims to leverage machine learning techniques to detect faults in optical transponders using constellation diagrams of the 16QAM receiver.
